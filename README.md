# C++ Programming Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my C++ Programming Repository!

This repository documents my journey from learning **C++ from scratch to advanced concepts**, including mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using C++. Whether you're a beginner looking to start your own path or a developer wanting to brush up on C++, this repo is for you!

## ðŸ“š What I'm Learning

### âœ… C++ Basics
- Syntax and structure
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions

### âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Destructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Friend functions and operator overloading

### âœ… Advanced C++
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Templates (Function and Class)
- STL (Standard Template Library): vectors, maps, sets, stacks, queues, etc.
- Lambda expressions
- Smart pointers

### âœ… Data Structures and Algorithms with C++
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Hashing
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Sliding Window, Two Pointer, and other problem-solving patterns
